# Project Rules and Context

## Project Overview
This is a site conversion project. We are converting an existing live site into a new Next.js-based implementation.

## Key Resources
- **Original Live Site**: Charles Plucker (https://www.charlesplucker.com or similar)
- **live-site.html**: Reference HTML from the original/live site
- **live-site.css**: Reference CSS from the original/live site

## Development Approach
When implementing new features or components:
1. **First pass**: Check `live-site.html` and `live-site.css` for how the feature was implemented in the original site
2. Use the original implementation as a reference for design, layout, and behavior
3. Adapt the implementation to work with the new Next.js/React architecture
4. Maintain the visual design and UX from the original while modernizing the code

## Important Notes
- Always consult the live site references before implementing new features
- The live site files serve as the source of truth for design decisions
- We're modernizing the tech stack while preserving the original design intent
