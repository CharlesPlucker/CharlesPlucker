# Charles Plucker Portfolio - AI Assistant Rules

## Project Overview

This is Charles Plucker's personal portfolio website - a "personal anchor on the web" that authentically represents who he is as a human and professional. The site helps potential employers and teams understand if they would be a good fit to work together.

**Core Philosophy:** Charles is "not for everyone, but if a good fit, a great fit" - evidenced by consistently long tenures and strong colleague testimonials.

---

## Content is Sacred

### Voice & Authenticity
- **ALL text content is Charles's authentic voice** - treat it as authoritative
- When making decisions about features or design, reference the site content as source of truth
- Never change the tone, voice, or philosophy expressed in the text
- The content intentionally filters for cultural fit, not broad appeal

### Key Themes to Honor
1. **Leading from the front** - Actions over words, embodied leadership
2. **Courageous communication** - Articulating needs, team dynamics, inefficiencies
3. **Values-driven** - Psychological safety, alignment, consensus
4. **Building the machine that builds the machine** - Systems thinking, long-term quality
5. **Team genius over individual ego** - Bringing out the best in others
6. **Measurable impact** - Concrete results (25% fewer cancellations, improved CI/CD, etc.)

## Technical Stack & Patterns

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 16** (Pages Router) - Static export for Cloudflare Pages
- **React 19** - Functional components only
- **TypeScript** - Strict mode enabled
- **CSS Modules** - Component-scoped styling

### Code Style

#### Components
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Functional component with TypeScript
interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string
  optional?: boolean
}

export default function MyComponent({ title, optional = false }: MyComponentProps) {
  return <div>{title}</div>
}
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Class components, default exports at bottom
class MyComponent extends React.Component { }
```

#### Styling
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: CSS Modules import
import styles from './Component.module.css'

<div className={styles.container}>
```

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Inline styles, styled-components, Tailwind
<div style={{ margin: '20px' }}>
```

#### File Organization
- Component files: `ComponentName.tsx`
- Style files: `ComponentName.module.css`
- Co-locate related files in `components/` directory
- Data files in `data/` (JSON format)

### Design System

#### Spacing (Viewport-based)
```css
padding: 7vw 4vw;        /* Desktop sections */
padding: 10vw 5vw;       /* Mobile sections */
gap: 60px;               /* Desktop grid gap */
gap: 40px;               /* Tablet grid gap */
gap: 30px;               /* Mobile grid gap */
```

#### Breakpoints
```css
@media (max-width: 750px)   { /* Mobile */ }
@media (max-width: 1024px)  { /* Tablet */ }
@media (min-width: 1250px)  { /* Desktop breakpoint 1 */ }
@media (min-width: 1480px)  { /* Desktop breakpoint 2 */ }
```

#### Colors
```css
--primary-bg: #253a4b;      /* Dark blue - buttons, accents */
--primary-hover: #1a2d3b;   /* Darker blue - hover states */
--text-primary: #000;       /* Black - headings */
--text-body: #333;          /* Dark gray - body text */
--text-muted: #666;         /* Gray - secondary/meta text */
--background: #fff;         /* White - page background */
```

#### Typography
```css
font-family: 'proxima-nova', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
font-weight: 300-400;       /* Light to regular, never bold */
h1, h2: 2.5rem;            /* Desktop headers */
h1, h2: 1.75rem;           /* Mobile headers */
body: 1rem - 1.1rem;       /* Body text */
line-height: 1.6-1.8;      /* Generous line height */
```

## Layout System

This project uses **two different grid systems** depending on layout complexity needs.

### Simple Grid (Default - Use This)

**Location:** `TwoColumnLayout.module.css`

**What it is:** A straightforward CSS Grid with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` that creates two equal columns on desktop and stacks on mobile.

**Usage:**
```typescript
import layoutStyles from './TwoColumnLayout.module.css'

<section className={`${styles.mySection} ${layoutStyles.container}`}>
  <div>Left column</div>
  <div>Right column</div>
</section>
```

**When to use:**
- Standard two-column layouts (most sections)
- Even splits (50/50)
- Simple content arrangement
- Default choice for new sections

**Currently used in:**
- Leading Section (image + text)
- Stop Doing Start Being section
- Most content sections

---

### Fluid Grid (Advanced - Use Sparingly)

**Location:** `styles/fluid-grid.css`

**What it is:** A 24-column CSS Grid system (8 columns on mobile) that allows precise positioning using grid coordinates. Inspired by modern editorial design systems.

**Usage:**
```typescript
<div className="fluid-engine">
  <div 
    className="grid-block"
    style={{
      '--mobile-grid-area': '1/2/9/10',
      '--desktop-grid-area': '1/2/23/14',
    } as React.CSSProperties}
  >
    Content here
  </div>
</div>
```

**When to use:**
- Complex layouts with overlapping elements
- Asymmetric columns (60/40, 37.5/50 instead of 50/50)
- Precise positioning with grid coordinates (e.g., "start at column 15, end at 24")
- Creative, magazine-style layouts
- Elements that need z-index layering

**Examples available in:** `examples/LeadingSection-with-fluid-grid.example.tsx`

**Documentation:** 
- `README-FLUID-GRID.md` - Complete guide
- `VISUAL-GRID-GUIDE.md` - ASCII diagrams showing the grid
- `grid-system-analysis.md` - Technical details

---

### Grid Comparison

| Feature | Simple Grid | Fluid Grid |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Complexity | Low | Medium |
| Column control | 2 columns (50/50) | 24 columns (any ratio) |
| Positioning | Automatic | Precise (row/col coordinates) |
| Learning curve | Minimal | Requires understanding grid-area |
| Best for | Standard layouts | Complex, creative layouts |
| Maintenance | Easy | More complex |
| **Use when** | **Most of the time** | Only when needed |

**Default choice:** Stick with simple grid (`TwoColumnLayout.module.css`) unless complexity requires fluid grid.

---

## Content Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Clear and direct** - No corporate jargon or buzzwords
- **Specific and concrete** - Measurable impacts, real examples
- **Honest and vulnerable** - "I courageously articulate my needs"
- **Values-forward** - Lead with what matters (team, quality, psychological safety)
- **Long-form friendly** - Not afraid of multiple paragraphs

### Button Text
- "Learn More About Charles" (not "Learn More" or "About Me")
- "Download Resume" (not "View Resume" or "CV")
- "Get In Touch" (not "Contact" or "Hire Me")

### Headings
- Use sentence case with periods for emphasis: "Leading from the front."
- Allow line breaks in headings: "Leading from the front.<br />Embodied."
- Keep semantic: h1 for page titles, h2 for section titles, h3 for subsections

---

## Image & Media Handling

### Images
- Use Next.js `<Image>` component with `unoptimized={true}` (required for static export)
- Feature cards use Patagonia trip photos (Torres Del Paine, Lago Grey, Mirador Britanico)
- Testimonials have individual photos in `/images/testimonials/`
- All images should maintain aspect ratio and use `objectFit: 'cover'` when needed

### Video
- Background video at `/videos/background.mp4` (16MB, intentionally high quality)
- Set `playbackRate = 0.5` for slow-motion effect
- Always include `autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, `playsInline` attributes

---

## Data Management

### Testimonials
Located at `data/testimonials.json`:
```json
{
  "author": "Full Name",
  "role": "Job Title",
  "text": "Full testimonial text with [...] for truncation",
  "imagePath": "/images/testimonials/filename.jpg"
}
```

### Years of Experience
Calculate dynamically from graduation date:
```typescript
const graduationDate = new Date(2010, 4) // May 2010
const yearsOfExperience = new Date().getFullYear() - graduationDate.getFullYear()
```

---

## Component Patterns

### State Management
- Use React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- Keep state local to components
- No global state management needed for this site

### Navigation States
The Navigation component has three scroll states:
- `top`: At page top (< 50px scroll)
- `video`: Within hero video (< viewport height - 100px)
- `below`: Below hero section

### Responsive Patterns
- **Mobile-first**: Write base styles for mobile, enhance for desktop
- **Progressive enhancement**: Core content accessible on all devices
- **Touch-friendly**: Minimum 44px touch targets on mobile

---

## Testing

### Current State
- Basic test file: `data/testimonials.test.ts`
- No comprehensive test suite (yet)

### Testing Philosophy (when implementing)
- **Test user-facing behavior**, not implementation details
- Focus on critical paths: navigation, content display, links
- Testimonial carousel logic should be tested
- Form submissions (if added) should be tested

---

## Deployment

### Static Export
```json
// next.config.js
{
  output: 'export',
  images: { unoptimized: true },
  trailingSlash: true
}
```

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build      # Generates static files in out/
npm start          # Preview production build locally
```

### Hosting
- **Platform:** Cloudflare Pages
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Output directory:** `out`
- **Branch:** `main`

## SEO & Discoverability

### Planned Enhancements
- [ ] Meta tags (title, description, OG tags) per page
- [ ] JSON-LD structured data (Person, ProfilePage schema)
- [ ] Generate Q&A dataset for AI recruiting tools
- [ ] sitemap.xml and robots.txt

### SEO Philosophy
- **Quality over quantity** - Not optimizing for maximum traffic
- **Right-fit optimization** - Help the right people find Charles
- **AI-readable** - Structure content for LLM understanding of fit

2. Match tone: direct, specific, values-forward
3. Avoid corporate jargon or generic statements
4. Include concrete examples and measurable impacts when possible

### Adding Documentation
1. Be comprehensive but not overwhelming
2. Include "why" along with "how"
3. Use examples liberally
4. Consider both humans and AI assistants as audience

### ❌ Don't Optimize for Everyone
- Don't water down the content to appeal to more people
- Don't remove "controversial" stances (values-driven, consensus-building, etc.)
- Don't make it generic or safe
- The site SHOULD filter for fit

### ❌ Don't Break Accessibility
- Don't use color alone to convey meaning
- Don't forget alt text on images
- Don't make touch targets too small
- Don't prevent keyboard navigation
